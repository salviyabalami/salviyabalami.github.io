                <p>
                    Welcome! I'm Salviya Balami, a student at Caltech studying Computer Science and
                    Business, Economics, and Management. I’m passionate about solving real-world 
                    problems through technology, and problem solving with a growing interest in 
                    machine learning, robotics, and full-stack development. On this site, you'll find 
                    more about my academic journey, the projects I've built, and experiences that have 
                    shaped me. Whether you're a collaborator, recruiter, or just curious, I hope you 
                    find something here that inspires you.

                    Before college, I attended the Math & Science Academy in Woodbury, Minnesota — 
                    the #1 ranked high school in the state — where I completed both middle and high 
                    school. During my time there, I explored a range of advanced problem-solving 
                    techniques and took rigorous courses in calculus, introductory computer science,
                    and the core sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics. I also built 
                    a strong foundation in Python and Java while developing my analytical thinking 
                    and curiosity for STEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently attend Caltech, where I study a range of courses in programming fundamentals,
                    software design, and web development. Through this coursework, I’ve gained hands-on 
                    experience and growing proficiency in languages such as Python, Java, C, HTML & CSS, 
                    and JavaScript. I'm particularly passionate about applying machine learning and computer 
                    vision to the development of autonomous vehicles, with a focus on enhancing their awareness 
                    and steering capabilities.

                    During my time at Caltech, I’ve contributed to a variety of programming projects across multiple 
                    languages. One of my favorite projects is a Java-based .io game I created called <span>Critters.io</span>,
                    which features a score-based system and diverse creatures, each equipped with unique attacks to 
                    maintain and compete for high scores. I also developed a custom web server in C that powers a 
                    playable version of <span>Pacman</span>, where movement is controlled via arrow keys — and the 
                    longer a key is held, the faster Pacman moves. Another standout project is <span>BeaverMaps</span>,
                    a Caltech-specific mapping application inspired by Apple Maps. Built in Java, it visualizes the
                    Pasadena area by pulling coordinate data from an online source to render roads and notable 
                    campus landmarks.

                    This summer, I’ll be joining a research cohort at the University of Minnesota through the NSF REU 
                    program, <span>Human-Centered Computing for Social Good</span>. My focus will be on integrating 
                    machine learning algorithms into dual-arm robots and the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot to perform 
                    everyday tasks traditionally handled by humans. The research is driven by the growing challenges 
                    of an aging population and aims to explore how robotics can play a role in supporting and enhancing 
                    quality of life.
