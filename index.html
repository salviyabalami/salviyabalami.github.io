                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Salviya (Joshua) Balami, and I’m currently a student at Caltech studying Computer Science and Business, Economics, and Management.
                    I’ve developed a strong foundation and <b>growing interest in machine learning, robotics, and full-stack development</b>, with experience in 
                    technologies that help solve real-world problems through creative and technical solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm particularly passionate about applying these skills <b>toward the development of autonomous vehicles, and I’m actively looking to pursue a career 
                    in this space — especially at the intersection of machine learning, perception, and control systems.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site highlights my academic journey, projects I've built, and the experiences that have shaped my path so far. Whether you're a potential 
                    collaborator, recruiter, or simply curious, I hope you find something here that resonates with or inspires you. <b>Feel free to explore my past 
                    projects and research, check out my GitHub, and connect with me on LinkedIn. I’m always open to conversations, ideas, and new opportunities!</b>

                    Before college, I attended the Math & Science Academy in Woodbury, Minnesota — 
                    the #1 ranked high school in the state — where I completed both middle and high 
                    school. During my time there, I explored a range of advanced problem-solving 
                    techniques and took rigorous courses in calculus, introductory computer science,
                    and the core sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics. I also built 
                    a strong foundation in Python and Java while developing my analytical thinking 
                    and curiosity for STEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently attend Caltech, where I study a range of courses in programming fundamentals,
                    software design, and web development. Through this coursework, <span>I’ve gained hands-on 
                    experience and growing proficiency in languages such as Python, Java, C, HTML & CSS, 
                    and JavaScript.</span> I'm particularly passionate about applying machine learning and computer 
                    vision to the development of autonomous vehicles, with a focus on enhancing their awareness 
                    and steering capabilities.

                    During my time at Caltech, I’ve contributed to several hands-on projects that reflect both my 
                    technical range and interests. I built <span>BeaverMaps</span>, a Java-based route-finding app that uses real-world
                     map data and optimized search algorithms to navigate Caltech’s campus. I created <span>Triviatron</span>, a 
                     full-stack trivia game using Node.js and JavaScript with streak-based scoring and dynamic UI updates. 
                     In C, in collaboration with my roomates, we developed a <span>physics-based Doodle Jump</span> engine compiled to Emscripten, 
                     with real-time collision detection and game state logic. Most recently, I launched <span>Baseline Threads</span>, 
                     an NBA-themed e-commerce site that displays real-time jersey data using API integration and client-side filtering 
                     to enhance the browsing experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m currently conducting research at the University of Minnesota as part of the NSF REU program, Human-Centered Computing
                    for Social Good. My work centers on <span>developing a cost-effective teleoperative arm for the Boston Dynamics SPOT robot</span> to 
                    enhance user accessibility and control speed. In parallel, I’m implementing an <span>imitation learning framework to enable SPOT 
                    to perform real-world pick-and-place tasks</span> by learning from human demonstrations.
